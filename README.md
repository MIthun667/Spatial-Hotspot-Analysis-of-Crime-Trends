# Spatial Hotspot Analysis of Crime Trends
# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a large crime dataset to understand spatial and temporal trends, using tools like geospatial analysis, K-means clustering, and time series segmentation. The ultimate goal is to identify crime hotspots and offer insights for targeted interventions.

# Data Description
# Dataset Source: [Kaggle]
Number of Entries: 7,084,435
# Key Columns:
Date: Timestamp of the crime report.
Primary Type: Type of crime.
Location Description: Description of the location where the crime occurred.
Latitude & Longitude: Geographical coordinates of the crime.
etc
# Tools and Technologies
Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
pandas: Data extraction and preprocessing.
matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization.
scikit-learn: K-means clustering to identify crime hotspots.
# Key Findings
[Key finding 1: Certain areas, high-risk zones.]
[Key finding 2: Crimes tend to peak during specific hours/days.]
# Challenges Faced
Large dataset size necessitated data sampling for faster analysis.
Handling missing data in columns like Latitude and Longitude.
# How to Replicate This Project
Dataset: Obtain the crime dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/crimes-2001-to-present/data].
Code: Clone this repository or download the provided Jupyter notebook/Python script.
Environment: Set up a Python environment and install the required libraries.
Execution: Run the script/notebook. Adjust parameters as needed.
# Future Work
Integrate demographic data to understand the impact of socio-economic factors on crime trends.
Apply advanced machine learning models for predictive analytics.
